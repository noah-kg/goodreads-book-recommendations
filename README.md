# Book Recommendations from Goodreads

In this project I implement a basic recommendation system using data scraped from the Goodreads website. This involves the following:

* Parsing book metadata
* Creating a book search engine
* Finding users with similar book interests
* Finding books that *those* users liked
* Creating & improving book recommendations
* Display recommendations in an aesthetic manner

To view the notebook, click on the .ipynb file above, or view it [here](https://nbviewer.org/github/noah-kg/goodreads-book-recommendations/blob/main/Combined.ipynb).
Note: the Combined.ipynb contains the whole project, while the seach, recommendations, and collaborative filerting notebooks have the individual sections of the project.
