# Book Recommendations from Goodreads

In this project I implement a basic recommendation system using data scraped from the Goodreads website. This involves the following:

* Parsing book metadata
* Creating a book search engine
* Finding users with similar book interests
* Finding books that *those* users liked
* Creating & improving book recommendations
* Display recommendations in an aesthetic manner
