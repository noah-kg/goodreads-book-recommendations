    "# Building A Book Recommendation System\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project we will implement a [recommendation system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recommender_system) for books. We will first read in and explore our datasets a bit, then we will try to build a basic recommender. Afterwards we'll try and improve upon it by implementing a collaborative-filtering engine. Our data will come from [Goodreads](https://sites.google.com/eng.ucsd.edu/ucsdbookgraph/home). The data was scraped by the team at UCSD in 2017, though some of the files were updated in May 2019.\n",

    "**What is Goodreads?**\n",
    "\n",
    "> Goodreads is the world's largest site for readers and book recommendations. Our mission is to help people find and share books they love. If you're looking for a place to discover a great book or to discuss your favorite books with a community of readers, you've found the right place! While we don't have a site tutorial, you can visit the [About us](https://www.goodreads.com/about/us) page to learn more!\n",
    "\n",
    "**What Can You Do On Goodreads?**\n",
    "\n",
    ">* See what books your friends are reading.\n",
    ">* Track the books you're reading, have read, and want to read.\n",
    ">* Check out your personalized book recommendations. Our recommendation engine analyzes 20 billion data points to give suggestions tailored to your literary tastes.\n",
    ">* Find out if a book is a good fit for you from our community’s reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "* Become familiar with recommender systems\n",
    "* Parse .json data for data we're interested in\n",
    "* Build basic recommendation system\n",
    "* Improve recommendation system with collaborative filtering\n",
    "* Display results in an aesthetically pleasing manner\n",

    "We are dealing with a couple of `.json.gz` files, which can be rather large (> 10 GB). Instead of reading in the entire file into a pandas dataframe, performing operations on it, copying it, modifying it, etc., we will stream through it one line at a time.

    "We'll have to import the relevant author information from a separate `.json` file. Some books have multiple authors listed. After some experimentation and digging, it seems that goodreads has included *everyone* who contributed to the book as an author - this means if someone illustrated something, translated something, or wrote the foreword for the book, they were counted as an author. It does appear that this information is supplied via the `role` key in dictionary for `authors` in our `goodreads_books.json` file (though it isn't always provided). It seems the main author is typically listed first, so we'll be using that information to display the main author."

    "# Creating A Search Engine\n",
    "\n",
    "In order for us to create a useable search engine for our dataset, we'll be instantiating a TF-IDF Vectorizer. This will essentially create a matrix of TF-IDF values, which will allow us to find books that are similar to (if not exactly the same as) our queried book. We will be using the built-in scikit-learn [TfidfVectorizer](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfVectorizer.html) function to do the heavy computation for us. [This page](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/11/how-sklearns-tfidfvectorizer-calculates-tf-idf-values/) gives a great explanation as to *how* scikit-learn calculates a TD-IDF matrix. Essentially, it will take every word in every title, and calculate how many times that word shows up in each book's title (including the original title). Then scikit-learn calculates how frequent or rare each word is in the entire dataset. Finally, it multiplies these two values together to give a number between 0 and 1. When we query for a book, it looks at these numbers to find relevant books (0 is not relevant and 1 is an exact match). This can obviously result in a *massive* matrix, which is why we cleaned up our titles earlier on."
